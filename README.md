# webutvikling-3

Delivery for web development 3 module, Autumn 2020.

Our task was to build a webpage showcasing PS5 games (or xbox series x...). 
I set up the webapi using .Net, using C#. 
Built on React.js.
During the exam, external files were hosted on MongoDB.

Functionality:
* CRUD operations. This was done with React Hooks and axios for http requests.
* webapi configured to allow CoRS.
* React routing (and nesting)
* Use of context

 
As a constraint, we had to build it with React Bootstrap as the front-end framework.
